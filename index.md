# Welcome {#welcome} mmjlk

It's possible to create beautiful documentation to share online with [Quarto](https://quarto.org) that auto-updates with [Github](http://github.com). This is very new and incredibly cool. This tutorial is an example of a quarto website --- it is a really powerful way to create and share tutorials, onboarding documentation, and so much more. You can communicate about science using the same reproducible workflow you and/or your colleagues use for analyses, whether or not you write code.

Creating websites with Quarto can be done without knowing R, Python or HTML, CSS, etc, and that's where we'll start. However, Quarto integrates with these tools so you can make your websites as complex and beautiful as you like as you see examples and reuse and remix from others in the open community. This tutorial borrows heavily from a lot of great tutorials and resources you should check out too -- there are links throughout.

## Example Quarto websites

We so far have been using Quarto for documentation using Markdown and Jupyter Notebooks.

-   [Openscapes Approach Guide](https://openscapes.github.io/approach-guide/)\
-   [2021 NASA Cloud Hackathon](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/2021-Cloud-Hackathon/)

See many more examples at the [quarto gallery](https://quarto.org/docs/gallery/)!

Are you making onboarding documentation? Check out [The Fay Lab Manual](https://thefaylab.github.io/lab-manual/) for inspiration on structure - you could also start there and make it your own.

## About

[Openscapes](https://openscapes.org) is about better science for future us. We help researchers reimagine data analysis, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research teams as part of the broader global open movement.

We're developing this tutorial to help folks of different technical skills use [Quarto](https://quarto.org) for documentation and tutorial building. This tutorial was originally created for several different audiences: [NASA-Openscapes](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io) researcher support engineers using Python, communications directors at organizations promoting open science who do not identify as coders, and fisheries scientists curious about transitioning from RMarkdown. We're hoping it's useful to folks with backgrounds as wide as these; if you find it useful or have suggestions for improvement, please let us know by clicking "Edit this page" or "Report an issue" at the upper right side of any page.

The structure of this tutorial follows a previous one: [Making free websites with RStudio's RMarkdown](https://jules32.github.io/rmarkdown-website-tutorial/index.html).

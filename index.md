# Welcome {#welcome}

It's possible to create beautiful documentation to share online with [Quarto](https://quarto.org) that auto-updates with [Github](http://github.com). This is very new and incredibly cool. It is a really powerful way to create and share tutorials, onboarding documentation, and so much more. You can communicate about science  using the same reproducible workflow you and/or your colleagues use for analyses, whether or not you yourself write code. 

Creating websites with quarto can be done without knowing R, Python or HTML, CSS, etc, and that's where we'll start. However, Quarto integrates with these tools so you can make your websites as complex and beautiful as you like as you see examples and reuse and remix from others in the open movement. This tutorial borrows heavily from a lot of great tutorials and resources you should check out too -- there are links throughout. 

## Example quarto sites

We so far have been using Quarto for documentation using Markdown and Jupyter Notebooks.

- [Champions Lessons Series](https://openscapes.github.io/series)
- [Openscapes Approach Guide](https://openscapes.github.io/approach-guide/)  
- [2021 NASA Cloud Hackathon](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/2021-Cloud-Hackathon/)

See many more examples at the [quarto gallery](https://quarto.org/docs/gallery/)!

### Inspiration

Are you making onboarding documentation? Check out [The Fay Lab Manual](https://thefaylab.github.io/lab-manual/) for inspiration on structure - you could also start there and make it your own. 

## About

[Openscapes](https://openscapes.org) is about better science for future us. We help researchers reimagine data analysis, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research teams as part of the broader global open movement.

We're developing this tutorial to help folks of different technical skills use [quarto](https://quarto.org) for documentation and tutorial building. This tutorial was originally created for both [NASA-Openscapes](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io) researcher support engineers and communications directors at organizations promoting open science. The structure follows a previous tutorial [Making free websites with RStudio's RMarkdown](https://jules32.github.io/rmarkdown-website-tutorial/index.html).

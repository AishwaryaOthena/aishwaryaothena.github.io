# Welcome {#welcome}

It's possible to create beautiful documentation for free using [Quarto](https://quarto.org) and making updates automatically republish on [Github](http://github.com). This is very new and incredibly cool. It is a really powerful way to create and share tutorials, onboarding documentation, and much more. You can communicate about science and help colleagues using the same reproducible workflow you and or your colleagues use for analyses.

This tutorial was created for several specific audiences: Deputy and Communications Directors at organizations that promote open science, and technical support engineers that support researchers who code. This tutorial is for both those audiences and for everyone in between: Creating websites with quarto can be done without knowing R, Python or HTML, CSS, etc, and that's where we'll start. However, Quarto integrates with these tools - it can combine RMarkdown and Jupyter notebooks in the same place - so the more you know the more complex and beautiful your website can be. This tutorial borrows heavily from a lot of great tutorials and resources you should check out too -- there are links throughout. 

## Examples

We have been using Quarto for documentation without any code, as well as for Python (and R code upcoming): 

- [Champions Lessons Series](https://openscapes.github.io/series). A collection of .md files.
- [Approach Guide](https://openscapes.github.io/approach-guide/).  A collection of .md and .qmd files.
- [2021 NASA Cloud Hackathon](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/2021-Cloud-Hackathon/). A collection of .ipynb and .md files. 


### Inspiration

Are you making onboarding documentation? Check out [The Fay Lab Manual](https://thefaylab.github.io/lab-manual/) for inspiration on structure - you could also start there and make it your own. 

## About

We're developing this tutorial to help folks of different technical skills use quarto for documentation and tutorial building. The structure follows a previous tutorial [Making free websites with RStudio's RMarkdown](https://jules32.github.io/rmarkdown-website-tutorial/index.html).

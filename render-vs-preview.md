title: Render vs. Preview
---

Making quarto websites involves terminology that might be unfamiliar. This is a light explainer to help you get going. 

As you work locally, you will save your files as you normally do. Saving writes your work to disk. 

## Render

Rendering is when...

It's like saying "show me".

Sometimes files get big and complicated with code, so Quarto will not render files by default. It will never run .ipynb files unless you tell it to.

## Preview/Serve
Preview is

- this has been called "Serve" in the past
- you don't ever need to serve if you're working in RStudio (?)

## When do I want Preview vs Serve?

Comparison to knitting in RMarkdown (?)


## If I'm in Jupyter Lab/Hub

In terminal, cd to repo...

### Troubleshooting

If it hangs/if I get errors:

Check the specific notebook, are there `---`? Delete those. Is there too much in the first raw cell? Change that

## If I'm in RStudio IDE

Build tab click buttons....

Terminal...

Or alternatively, R console...

When does it preview automatically?

Note: Revisit - maybe this should be "JupyterLab" rather than Hub.

## Setup

## Install Quarto

Download Quarto from <https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/>. Follow the installation wizard on your computer. When it is complete, you won't see an application or any new software, but it is now available to RStudio.

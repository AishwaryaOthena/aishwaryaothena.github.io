## Setup RStudio and GitHub

For a workflow with RStudio and GitHub on your local computer, you will need four things: 

1. R
1. RStudio
1. Git
1. GitHub

Follow the [UCSB MEDS Installation Guide](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/meds-install-guide.html) for detailed instructions on how to create accounts, download, install, and configure on Mac and Windows. (For an even more detailed walk-through, see [Allison Horst's ESM 206 Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zx2upJJqFZe94O3BQSMI56Z76s3haLXC0otKSpcZaJQ/edit)). Thanks for sharing Allison!

If you'd like to practice the workflow with RStudio and GitHub, follow [R for Excel Users' GitHub Chapter](https://rstudio-conf-2020.github.io/r-for-excel/github.html). This describes how to create a GitHub repository, clone it to RStudio, make edits, and practice syncing. 

## Install Quarto

Download Quarto from <https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/>. Follow the installation wizard on your computer. When it is complete, you won't see an application or any new software, but it is now available to RStudio.

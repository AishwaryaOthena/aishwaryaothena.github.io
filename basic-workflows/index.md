Building websites can be done in limited way from the broswer, but better yet using the same reproducible workflow you can use for your analyses and collaborations. It is very iterative. You can do it all from the tools you already use, with a combination of clicking or typing commands as you feel comfortable. 

1. Add content (text, code, images, etc) in a file - can be a .md, .Rmd, .qmd, .ipynb...
1. ~~Knit the RMarkdown file to view~~ << Preview?
1. Update `_quarto.yml` (perhaps, if it is a new file)
1. Render the website
1. Repeat, repeat, repeat
1. Commit and push your website to github, it's live!
  1. If from the browser, no need to push and each commit will trigger the guild
1. Repeat all of the above

The following sections show how to do this with different tools on your local computer. If you don't already have a local workflow to edit files and sync to GitHub, I recommend RStudio. You don't need to code in R to use it, and it has powerful editor features that make for happy workflows.

Let's explore this basic workflow with some different tools. See all the tools that are supported at <https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/>.

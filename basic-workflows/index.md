title: Quarto Overview
---

Editing your quarto site has the same basic workflow, no matter which tool you're using to edit and interact with GitHub:

1. Create content (text, code, images, etc) in a file - can be a .md, .Rmd, .qmd, .ipynb...
1. ~~Quarto Preview/Serve to see your updates as you go~~
1. Update `_quarto.yml` (perhaps, if you've created a new file)
1. Quarto Render individual files and/or the whole website
1. Repeat, repeat, repeat
1. Commit and push your website to GitHub, your updates will publish automatically!
  1. If from the browser, no need to push and each commit will trigger the build
1. Repeat all of the above

The following sections show how to do this with different tools on your local computer. **If you don't already have a local workflow to edit files and sync to GitHub, I recommend RStudio.** You don't need to know R to use RStudio, and it has powerful editor features that make for happy workflows. See all the tools that are supported at <https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/>.

## `_quarto.yml` quick primer

`_quarto.yml` is your control panel

Spacing is super important.

## Plan what you want to do

From this starting site, what do you want to do? You'll likely want to delete and add chapters, reorder existing chapters, and edit content. We'll show a few examples of the quarto workflow to get you started.

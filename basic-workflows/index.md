title: Quarto Overview

Building websites can be done in limited way from the broswer, but better yet using the same reproducible workflow you can use for your analyses and collaborations. It is very iterative. You can do it all from the tools you already use, with a combination of clicking or typing commands as you feel comfortable. 

1. Add content (text, code, images, etc) in a file - can be a .md, .Rmd, .qmd, .ipynb...
1. TODO: Quarto Preview/Serve to see your updates as you go
1. Update `_quarto.yml` (perhaps, if it is a new file)
1. Quarto Render individual files and/or the whole website
1. Repeat, repeat, repeat
1. Commit and push your website to github, it's live!
  1. If from the browser, no need to push and each commit will trigger the build
1. Repeat all of the above

The following sections show how to do this with different tools on your local computer. **If you don't already have a local workflow to edit files and sync to GitHub, I recommend RStudio.** You don't need to know R to use RStudio, and it has powerful editor features that make for happy workflows. See all the tools that are supported at <https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/>.

## Editing `_quarto.yml`

TODO. 

Spacing is super important.

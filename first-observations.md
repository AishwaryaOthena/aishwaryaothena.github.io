## Your turn

These instructions are for starting with an existing Quarto site and copying it into your space to edit. 

### Choose an existing website/book

A simple option is to start with this site: <https://github.com/Openscapes/quarto-website-tutorial>. 

Other options of potential interest: 

- <https://github.com/NASA-Openscapes/2021-Cloud-Hackathon>
- <https://github.com/podaac/2022-SWOT-Ocean-Cloud-Workshop>

### Fork the existing repo

Follow these steps from Gavin Fay, using the repo you chose.

<https://github.com/thefaylab/lab-manual/wiki/Quick-steps-to-making-a-copy-of-the-lab-manual-&-publishing-it>

Now you're set up to edit from the GitHub browser and your book will be republished with our edits. A workflow from the browser if good for getting started/making small contributions but is definitely limited. Once you feel comfortable here, you can move to a different setup.
